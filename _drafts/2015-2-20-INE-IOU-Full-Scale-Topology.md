description: Being back at a VAR (Value Added Reseller) or Cisco Partner the CCIE has perceivable value.
summary: I had left the CCIE behind a bit, still wanted it, but wasn't a priority for me. Being back at a VAR (Value Added Reseller) or Cisco Partner however, now there's actual perceivable value. This is not just a pay increase or bonus, but also for my employer, having a number benefits them as well. Maybe it's time I get back on it and get it over with once and for all.

The **CCIE** was a bit in my rear view mirror, still wanted it, but wasn't a priority for me. Being back at a **VAR** (Value Added Reseller) or Cisco Partner however, now there's actual perceivable value. This is not just a pay increase or bonus, but also for my employer, having a number benefits them as well. Maybe it's time I get back on it and get it over with once and for all. It's not just money, but maybe also to get that itch I can't quite scratch and let it be gone. There are plenty of posts out there on the merits or non-merits of the **CCIE**, this isnâ€™t one of  them.
