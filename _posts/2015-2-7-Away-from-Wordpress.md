description: 'My move from Wordpress self hosted to Jekyll on Github'
summary: Recently I seriously considered shutting down the blog. I wasn't writing as often as I wanted. It was costing money to keep up, the free services are really sub-par from what I've experienced. It wasn't a ton of money, but use vs cost wasn't justifiable really.

Recently I seriously considered shutting down the blog. I wasn't writing as often as I wanted. It was costing money to keep up, the free services are really sub-par from what I've experienced. It wasn't a ton of money, but use vs cost wasn't justifiable really. The Scott Lowe <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe" target="_blank">@scott_lowe</a> published his <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/06/the-story-behind-the-migration/" target="_blank">story on migrating to Jekyll on Github</a> and I found it interesting.

### Why?

Jekyll was never a consideration for me, but Scott's post inspired me to take a look and see if it was worth the migration. Looking at migration tools (there are plenty of tutorials) Scott's included, that's not what this is. Not all posts were moved, only the ones that received enough attention and I thought were worth the move. This service is offered free by <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a> and though I don't pay as much attention as I should to writing more often, being free, it's hard to say no.

The blog sometimes serves as a way of note keeping, or documenting experiences. So far, my experience with Jekyll on Github has all been positive. It's a learning curve in a way (though much simpler than Wordpress) and requires a different mindset to writing.

But here are a few things:

* I was already using markdown to write
	* This is native and the way to do it with Jekyll
* Static pages get served up much quicker than db driven sites
* Wordpress is great, but as a CMS I wasn't really getting the most out of it
* Much simpler plugins (not all are supported by Github)
	* If you need more plugins, run your own Jekyll instance on a hosted server
* It offers everything I need to document, and write

### Summary

Now this won't be for everyone, but it works for me and so far, I'm not looking back.  Now if I can just get my things together and write more, it'll be even better.
