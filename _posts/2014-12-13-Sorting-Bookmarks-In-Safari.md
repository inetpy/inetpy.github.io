If you’re anything like me, then you may just be a bit OCD or ANAL when it comes to some things. One of those things is, I like my bookmarks/favorites in alphabetical order with **folders** sorted first.

I’ve recently been trying out safari 8 on the mac, just because, something new. But found out a long standing issue, there’s no automatically “sort by name” feature.

With some searching I found a great little App called <a href="http://www.safarisort.com/" target="_blank">SafariSort</a>, it’s simple and does not have many fancy options. Basically, it has three options, **Alphabetically, Folders First** and **Quit**.

* **Alphabetically** – does what it’s name says, sorts by name but ignores folders first option. All folders are sorted and place as the name would have them.
* **Folders First** – sorts alphabetically and puts folders at the top, which is my preferred method.
* **Quit** – well, pretty obvious, quits and does nothing

The app will quit and restart Safari in the process, not sure if tabs recover, did not try.
